## MAC (Media Access Control)
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on the physical network segment. It is used to identify the device on the network and distinguish it from other devices. MAC addresses are typically assigned by the manufacturer of the device and are stored in the device's hardware, such as its network card.

Every device that connects to a network using Ethernet or Wi-Fi has a unique MAC address. MAC addresses are made up of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens. For example, a MAC address might look like this: 00:11:22:33:44:55.

MAC addresses are used by the network to identify the source and destination of data transmitted over the network. They are also used to filter traffic and restrict access to certain devices or network resources.
